## Problem 1 

Create 3 columns (Full screen)
- Inside the first column there are 5 rows
- Inside the second column there are 2 rows and 2 columns
- Inside the third column there are 5 column and 5 rows

Add 3 breakpoints
- When the screen x is less than 1200px the third column will now have 3 columns but will maintain the same number of the total elements
- When the screen x is less than 800px the first column will only have 5 rows
- When the screen x is less than 200px there are gonna be 3 rows instead of the 3
columns that we had at the start.
